# Brainstorm Panel

This is a desktop application that allows you to chat with two AI models at the same time. It uses the PyQt6 library to create a graphical user interface and the QWebEngineView class to display the web pages of the two models. The application is designed to be used as a tool for brainstorming and idea generation.

- How about allowing another model to chat with these two models?
